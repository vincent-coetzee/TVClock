### **ClockTV**

This is a sample project for tvOS ( i.e. the Apple TV ). It requires Xcode 9 and tvOS 11. I noticed when using the Apople TV, that there does not seem to be a clock application for it. I find this quite irritating because often when I am cooking, I watch TV while I'm waiting for something to cook, and I want a mechanism to get timer notifications on my Apple TV. Once this is finished it will handle things like that. Currently the application merely shows a number of clocks. It makes nice use of the Core Animation Framework to animate the various clock hands.
